# 🔐 RF-Based Secure Audio Communication with Encryption

This project implements a real-time password-protected audio communication system using **Frequency Modulation (FM)** and **XOR-based encryption** in **MATLAB**. It simulates how secure voice transmission works in RF systems.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🎤 Real-time audio recording
- 🧼 Butterworth filtering
- 🔐 Password-based symmetric encryption (XOR with pseudorandom key)
- 📡 FM Modulation & Demodulation
- 🎧 Final decryption and playback
- ❌ Blocks decryption with wrong password
- 📊 Signal visualization using waveform plots

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- MATLAB (R2023a or later)
- Simulink (for optional block-level model)
- Audio Toolbox
- Signal Processing Toolbox

---

## 🔁 How It Works

1. User records audio
2. Filters the audio using a low-pass filter
3. Encrypts the audio using a password-derived key
4. Modulates encrypted audio using FM
5. Demodulates at the receiver
6. Decrypts using the same password
7. Only correct password retrieves clean audio
